Suppose the transition matrix of a finite-state, irreducible, aperiodic chain is doubly stochastic; that is, each of its columns also sums to 1. Explain why the stationary distribution must be uniform.\n",

A “random to front” shuffle is defined as follows: Pick one of the 52 cards uniformly at random and move it to the front of the deck (which you are welcome to think of as the top of the deck, if you prefer). Explain why if you perform this move over and over again, in the long run the deck will become well shuffled; that is, all permutations will be equally likely. [Hint: Set up an appropriate chain and use Part **a**. You might want to try it out first with an alphabet of just the letters A, B, and C.]"
