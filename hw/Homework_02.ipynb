    "This exercise is an introduction to experiments in which randomizing a parameter can affect dependence and independence. The setting is simple but powerful: it demonstrates some fundamental ideas of Bayesian prediction. We will use the same ideas in more complex settings later in the course.\n",

Under this assumption the tosses are independent, that is, knowing the results of some tosses doesn't change probabilities for how other tosses will come out. So for example the chance of two heads in two tosses is $p \\cdot p$.\n",

Make sure you understand the logic and especially the suggested visualization; that's what's going to be applied later. Note also how the logic can be applied or modified in variations of the initial problem setting.\n",

    "The maximum and minimum of a random sample of numbers are called the *extrema* of the sample. Distributions of extrema are best described using the left or right hand tail probabilities. In this exercise you will see how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix a positive integer $n$. In data science, a *sample* is a sequence of random variables $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ defined on an outcome space, and $n$ is called the *sample size*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our sample is positive integer valued, as follows. Fix a positive integer $N$ and suppose each $X_i$ has possible values in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, N\\}$. \n",

    "**a) [Describing an event]** The event that a sample maximum is \"small\" is straightforward to describe in terms of the individual elements of the sample.

    "\n",
    "**b) [Using a probability model]** In Data 8, you found empirical distributions of statistics by simulation. Now you will start finding the exact distribution of a statistic by probability theory. For this, you need a probability model. Let's start with a simple one. Suppose $n$ draws are made at random with replacement from the numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, N\\}$. Let $X_i$ be the number that appears on the $i$th draw. Use Part **a** to find $P(W_n \\le k)$, for each $k$ in the range $1 \\le k \\le N$.\n",

Use this and Part **b** to find $P(W_n = k)$ for $1 \\le k \\le N$ and to show algebraically that $\\sum_{k=1}^N P(W_n = k) = 1$. Congratulations â€“ you have found the distribution of the sample maximum for a sample of independent uniform draws from the integers 1 through $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**d) [Changing the statistic]** Continue under the assumptions in Part **b**. Modify Parts **a** through **c** to find the distribution of the sample minimum $V_n$, as follows. For the event that the sample minimum is \"large\", fill in the blank with an appropriate mathematical symbol or English phrase. \n",
    "\n",
    "The event \"$V_n > k$\" is the same as the event \"each of $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ is $\\underline{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} k$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this observation and the ideas of the previous parts to find $P(V_n = k)$ for $1 \\le k \\le N$.\n",
