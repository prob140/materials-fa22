    "- Attempt the homework problems by yourself with the text, section work, and practice materials all at hand. Sometimes the week's lab will help as well. The two steps above will help this step go faster and be more fruitful.\n",

But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\"\n",
