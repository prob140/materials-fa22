    "# Lab 4: Multinomial Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "Many questions in data science involve populations that can be partitioned into categories of individuals. For example, in Data 8 you classified individuals into one of two classes. Data 100 examines logistic regression as a different approach to binary classification. These methods can be extended to multiple categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a more fundamental level, it is important to understand how a random sample from a categorical population reflects the population. As you know, the [multinomial](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_06/03_Multinomial_Distribution.html#id1) is the joint distribution of the counts of the different categories in a random sample of a fixed size. \n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, suppose the population has $k$ categories of individuals in proportions $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^k p_i = 1$. For $1 \\le i \\le k$ let $N_i$ be the number of elements in Category $i$ in a sample of size $n$ drawn at random with replacement from the population. Then the joint distribution of of $N_1, N_2, \\ldots, N_k$ is multinomial with parameters $n$ and $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The counts $N_1, N_2, \\ldots, N_k$ are dependent since $\\sum_{i=1}^k N_i = n$ which is a constant. In this lab you will study the dependence between pairs $N_i$ and $N_j$ and develop a way to predict $N_j$ based on the value of $N_i$. You will see that the method is closely connected to the linear regression that you studied in Data 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you will learn in this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to simulate multinomial counts in Python\n",
    "- How to find the covariance of two multinomial counts and hence the correlation between them\n",
    "- How to predict one multinomial count based on another, and how this is connected to linear regression\n",

    "What you have learned in this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to simulate multinomial variables in Python\n",
    "- How probability distributions and properties such as expectation, standard deviation, and correlation are related to empirical distributions and their corresponding properties\n",
    "- How to find the correlation between two multinomial counts\n",
    "- That conditional expectation can be thought of as a way to make predictions\n",
    "- That for predicting one multinomial count based on another, based on a large amount of data, the empirical regression line looks very much like the conditional expectation of the response given the predictor"

    "## Submission Instructions ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Many assignments throughout the course will have a written portion and a code portion. Please follow the directions below to properly submit both portions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Written Portion ###\n",
    "*  Scan all the pages into a PDF. You can use any scanner or a phone using applications such as CamScanner. Please **DO NOT** simply take pictures using your phone. \n",
    "* Please start a new page for each question. If you have already written multiple questions on the same page, you can crop the image in CamScanner or fold your page over (the old-fashioned way). This helps expedite grading.\n",
    "* It is your responsibility to check that all the work on all the scanned pages is legible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Portion ###\n",
    "* Save your notebook using File > Save and Checkpoint.\n",
    "* Generate a PDF file using File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX. This might take a few seconds and will automatically download a PDF version of this notebook.\n",
    "    * If you have issues, please make a follow-up post on the general Lab 4 Ed thread.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Submitting ###\n",
    "* Combine the PDFs from the written and code portions into one PDF.  [Here](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) is a useful tool for doing so. \n",
    "* Submit the assignment to Lab 4 on Gradescope. \n",
    "* **Make sure to assign each page of your pdf to the correct question.**\n",
    "* **It is your responsibility to verify that all of your work shows up in your final PDF submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have questions about scanning or uploading your work, please post a follow-up to the [Ed thread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/24954/discussion/1695227) on this topic. "
